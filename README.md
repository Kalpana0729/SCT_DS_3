SkillCraft Technology Data Science Task 3 – Decision tree Classifier for prediction

"Objective"
The aim of this project is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (Yes/No) based on the Bank Marketing dataset. Using a Decision Tree Classifier, we analyze customer demographics and campaign details to build a predictive model and visualize decision-making patterns.

"Tools & Technologies"
  -> Jupyter Notebook → Development and experimentation
  
"Python Libraries"
  -> Pandas → Data manipulation and preprocessing
  -> Matplotlib → Data visualization
  -> Scikit-learn → Machine learning (Decision Tree, metrics, preprocessing)

"Contents"
  -> Predication.py
  -> Output.pdf

"Results & Insights"
  -> Model Performance
      Accuracy: ~89%
      Precision (Class 0 - No): 0.92
      Precision (Class 1 - Yes): 0.59
      The model performs well at predicting customers who do not subscribe, but struggles with the minority class (Yes).

"Knowledge Gained"
  -> Learned how to apply Decision Trees for classification problems.
  -> Understood the importance of feature encoding for categorical variables.
  -> Observed class imbalance in real-world datasets and its effect on performance metrics.
  -> Visualized decision-making paths to improve interpretability of ML models.
